# ASP.NET Core MVC

**Note:** For ASP.NET MVC 5.x, Web API 2.x, and Web Pages 3.x (not ASP.NET Core), see <https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetWebStack>

ASP.NET Core MVC gives you a powerful, patterns-based way to build dynamic websites that enables a clean separation of concerns and gives you full control over markup for enjoyable, agile development. ASP.NET Core MVC includes many features that enable fast, TDD-friendly development for creating sophisticated applications that use the latest web standards.

ASP.NET Core MVC includes support for building web pages and HTTP services in a single aligned framework that can be hosted in IIS or self-hosted in your own process.

See the [ASP.NET Core MVC documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/).
